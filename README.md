Project Mission Statement Ideas
Using Lidar to help visually impared with navigating indoor environments, giving a audible response to approaching obstacles such as doorways or walls
Phase one getting app to function for walls/ obscure objects
How to test and use lidar sensor on iphone, come up with way to develop the application, using xcode on mac mini
Primary functions for Phase 1:
Get app into prototype, give audible information on distancing using scene depth

Phase two getting app to function for doorways
Find test data online to show how test data points can show app functionality when development approved
Using section system, detecting objects in grid like pattern, if they appear in each grid section shown below, Have auditory responses, detection in each section, do some app appearance editing 
Use CAD diagram to show the coordinates of each section, boundaries ect
